Brain-Tumor-Detection
ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using Image Processing

This project applies **classical image processing techniques** with **OpenCV** and **NumPy** to detect brain tumors from MRI images.  
It was originally developed in a Jupyter Notebook and later converted into a Python script.

ðŸš€ Features
- Load MRI scans in grayscale
- Histogram analysis of pixel intensities
- Image enhancement with Gaussian blur & median filtering
- Morphological operations (gradient, opening, closing, erosion, dilation)
- Thresholding for tumor region segmentation
- Contour detection to highlight and measure tumor area & perimeter
- Final visualization of tumor detection using Matplotlib
